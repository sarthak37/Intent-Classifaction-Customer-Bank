This code is for intent classification using the DeBERTa model with TensorFlow. It includes data preparation, tokenization, model training, evaluation using a confusion matrix, and testing on sample sentences. The DeBERTa model is fine-tuned on a dataset of utterances for chatbots/virtual assistants. The code employs TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, and other libraries for machine learning tasks. The training and evaluation include visualizations of loss and accuracy. The model is then tested on new utterances to predict intents.
